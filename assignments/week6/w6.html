								<p>This week, we worked with sensors to translate between physical quantities and electrical signals.</p>
								
								<h3 id="Res">Resistive Sensor:</h3>
								<p>
									One of my classmates, Andrei, had spent the previous week working with an ultrasonic sensor. The <a  href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/abdularbi17/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04-with-arduino-tutorial-327ff6">HC-SR04</a> sends out a pulse and then receives it to estimate the distance of an object from the sensor. I had an idea of using this to create a theremin-like instrument. With code, I segmented up distances within a meter range into different notes; by placing your hand in any one of these ranges, the note corresponding to the region will be played on a buzzer. See the schematic below.

								<p>When calibrating the system, I tried using both my own send and receive code, as well as a pre-written <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/hcsr04-ultrasonic-sensor/">library</a>. Both were working, but I decided to use the library for calibration to see how good it was (whereas with my capacitive sensor, calibration was written from scratch). Below shows a graph of the distance recorded by the HC-SR04 versus the distance I measured with meter sticks.</p>
							
								<span class="inset"><img src="res.png" alt="" width="500"><br></span>
							
								<p>The library is really quite good! Definitely not perfect, but within a centimeter or so for most ranges. The major problem which is not reflected in this graph is variation of the reported value. Variation is small, but led to a lot of rapid shifting of notes in my simplified theremin setup. This could be resolved by setting a small timer after each note change if I decide to develop this further.</p>
							
								<h3 id="Cap">Capacitive Sensor:</h3>
								<p>
									I've been messing around with the idea of a fountain for a little while, so I wanted to use capacitance as a measure for water. I modeled my design after an example in class, although applied to a plastic bottle rather than a paper cup. This sensor could detect when water levels in the small fountain get too low, either due to evaporation or a leak. It could both stop the pump from running and wasting electricity as well as send an alert to the fountain owner (me). Here it is, and here is the associated code:

int vol;  //variable for conversion of tx_rx to volume
int analog_pin = A3;

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      //Pin 4 provides the voltage step
    Serial.begin(9600);

								<p>Capacitive sensors use principles of capacitance to change the signal that gets through a circuit. </p>
							
								<p>Here is a graph of my initial calibration measurements taken by adding water volume from a pipette into the sensor bottle and recording the reported value: </p>
							
								<span class="inset"><img src="cap_cal.png" alt="" width="500"><br></span>
							
								<p>I used this data to create bounds for the Arduino <code>map()</code> function; however, the relationship is clearly nonlinear, so the mapping was not great. In addition, slight changes in the physical environment, such as a rotation or adjusted wire, created drastic changes in the analog read values. Maybe a built-in calibration process in the setup function could be helpful for a system like this.</p>
							
								<span class="inset"><img src="cap_lin.png" alt="" width="500"><br></span>
							
								<p>I found that the square root of the actual volume is proportional to the analog read from the arduino, so it may have been better to map using a specialized square root function. This definitely does not quite describe the relationship, but is much closer than the other models I tried.</p>

								<h3 id="MIDI">Convert Arduino UNO to MIDI Device:</h3>
								<p>
									This conversion process takes only a few steps, but resources are scattered across different websites. I am collecting them here and giving a brief description. The overall steps are as follows:
									<ol>
										<li>Download firmware</li>
										<li>Push firmware to Arduino UNO</li>
										<li>Upload MIDI sketch to Arduino</li>
										<li>Run MIDI device</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
							
								<p>1. Download Firmware: The files you'll need are the normal <a href="https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/tree/master/firmwares/atmegaxxu2">Arduino UNO firmware</a> from <strong>arduino-usbserial/Arduino-usbserial-uno.hex</strong> and the <a href="https://github.com/kuwatay/mocolufa">dualMocoLUFA</a> from <strong>HEX/dualMoco.hex</strong>.</p>
						
								<p>2. Push Firmware: Follow <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/hacking/software/DFUProgramming8U2">this guide</a> to push code to the Arduino UNO. Upload the MIDI firmware. To ensure that this worked, your Arduino should not be recognized under Ports in the Arduino IDE. </p>
						
								<p>3. Upload Sketch: See Section 3 of <a href="http://morecatlab.akiba.coocan.jp/lab/index.php/aruino/midi-firmware-for-arduino-uno-moco/?lang=en">this page</a> for a good description. Connect ICSP pin 4 and pin 6 near the reset button, which will put the board in Arduino Serial mode. Connect the board to computer and upload the example sketch under File &gt; Examples &gt; 04.Communication &gt; MIDI, or whatever MIDI program you have designed.</p>
						
								<p>4. Run MIDI Device: Disconnect ICSP pins 4 and 6 to convert the Arduino to a MIDI device. Connect it to your computer and it should run as a MIDI device. You can incorporate this directly into a DAW, or just check that your MIDI signal is being sent to the computer with a software like <a href="https://hautetechnique.com/midi/midiview/">MidiView</a>.</p>
