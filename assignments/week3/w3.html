								<p>Note: This week was very rough and I wasn't able to work on my project until the last day. But I was able to finish the assignment completely, so I am very proud! However, my documentation will be quite poor since I am writing this at 3 am. I will improve on it in the upcoming days, though. I am including the videos and images that prove I did everything that the assignment required, in lieau of more extensive documentation.</p>
								
								<h3 id="Ideation">Ideation</h3>

								<p>My idea was a take on the basic model we've been seeing this week. I wanted to make a kinetic sculpture that could incorporate the tresillo rhythm. This is a rhythm that places emphasis on the 1, 4, and 7 beats in a standard 8-beat pattern. It's also known as a 3-3-2 rhythm. My goal was to make a sculture with three spokes poking outward that moved such that each spoke represented one of the three main beats in the tresillo rhythm.</p>

								<h3 id="Prototype">Prototype</h3><p>
								I was able to do a very rough prototype using cardboard (cutting it with an exacto knife, making holes with drills, and joining pieces together with hot glue). It worked surprisingly well.

								<h3 id="Next">Next Steps</h3>
								The next step is to make it work better (there is a lot of fricition and the wheels don't always turn, as one can see in the video). I hope to do this by using more precise pieces, designing them in Fusion 360 and cutting them with the laser cutter. Additionally, next week I hope to use more programming to be able to improve the performance and perhaps even simplify the design.
